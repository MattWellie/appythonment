# appythonment

US state apportionment calculator in Python

This takes the apportionment method discussed in https://openargs.com/oa486-apportionment-might-not-be-final/ and makes a quick script to run it

That's all...

# Usage:

python state_representation.py

the inputs are currently hard coded because I'm very lazy and this was only supposed to be a joke

alter `max_reps` to alter the... maximum number of reps
set `use_geometric` to False to use the Arithmetic mean instead
